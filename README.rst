The starlingx/config repository handles the StarlingX configuration management
services.

Its key component is the System Inventory Service (Sysinv), which provides the
system command-line interface (CLI) [1]_.

This repository is not intended to be developed standalone, but rather as part
of the StarlingX Source System, which is defined by the StarlingX manifest [2]_.
